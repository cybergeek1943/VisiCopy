In addition to the functionality that robocopy provides, VisiCopy introduces features such as multiprocessing & process management;
overall progress (rather than just the progress of a single file); and many other features.</p>
<p>I have developed VisiCopy as a free and open source software. I do not have any contributors yet; hence, this project takes 
a significant amount of time and dedication. You can help the development of this software through donations, code contributions, 
and sharing VisiCopy with others. Any support would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you for using VisiCopy!</p>
